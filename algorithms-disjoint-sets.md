# ALGORITHMS - DISJOINT SETS
(http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/topological-sorting/)

## Procedure
The procedure needs to quickly identify some vertex with in-degree 0, it
maintains the in-degree of each vertex in an array in-degree indexed by the
vertices, and it maintains a list next of all the vertices with in-degree 0

## Disjoint Sets
- Group of ordered elements where order does not matter
- Used to solve the equivalence problem
