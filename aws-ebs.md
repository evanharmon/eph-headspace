# AWS ELASTIC BLOCK STORAGE
SSD, General Purpose - GP2 (Up to 10,000 IOPS)
SSD, Provisioned IOPS - IO1 (More than 10,000 IOPS)
HDD, Throughput Optimized - ST1 - frequently accessed workloads
HDD, Cold - SC1 - less frequently accessed data
HDD, Magnetic - Standard - cheap, infrequently accessed storage

## Block Storage - Disk in the Cloud
Attached to an EC2 Instance

## Zones / Regions
Exist in specific AZ Zones NOT across multiple zones
stored in multiple physical locations at no addt'l charge

## EBS Databases
EBS complex transactional databases should be backed up using the database
management system so distributed transactions/logs can be checkpointed

## Backups
AWS does not perform any backups - customer must do this

## GP2 (General Purpose SSD)
99.999% availability
3 IOPS per GB up to 10,000 IOPS
Burst to 3000 IOPS for volumes under 1Gib

## Provisioned IOPS SSD (IO1)
designed for I/O intensive apps like relational DBs and NoSQL databases
Use if you need more than 10,000 IOPS

## Magnetic (Standard)
Lowest cost per gig of all EBS
for data accessed infrequently, like fileservers

## Limitations
- 1 EBS = 1 EC2, cannot share across multiple EC2
- 1GB to 16TB
- st1, sc1 cannot be root volumes

## Init State
raw, unformatted block devices
you can create file system on top of EBS volume

## Sharing EBS snapshots
Can be shared publically on a read-only permission level
can only share unencrypted

## Snapshots
- incremental, only blocks that have changed since last snapshot
- cannot share encrypted snapshots
- block-level, stored on S3, incremental
- first one can take a while, subsequent snapshots will likely be quicker
- may contain deleted files with sensitive data
- copy to new EBS volume to be sure deleted files are not included
- encrypted volumes are automatically encrypted snapshots, restores from

## Root Volume Snapshots
Taking a snapshot automatically stops the volume - beware on production!

## Wipe
DoD 5220.22-M or NIST 800-88 wipe methods available

## Encryption
- Encrypts on server that hosts EC2 instance, so data encrypted in transit from
EC2 instance to EBS storage
- Only available on M,C,R,G EC2 instance types

## Best Practices
- encrypt EBS volumes and snapshots with AES-256
- take snapshots regularly since EBS limited to specific zones
- EBS volumes that serve as root, you should stop the instance before taking the
snapshot. (Make sure EC2 won't terminate on stop)

## Snapshot Of RAID Array
Problem: take a snapshot, excludes data held in cache by applications and OS. Across multiple volumes in RAID array, this can be problematic due to interdependencies of the array

Solution: Stop application from writing to disk, flush all caches to the disk
Freeze file system
Unmount the RAID Array
Shutting down the associated EC2 instance

## Warning Status
volume is degraded or severely degraded

## Impaired Status
volume is stalled or not available
