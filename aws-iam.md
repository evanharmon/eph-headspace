## Best Practices
[AWS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html)
- lock away your AWS account (root) access keys
- create individual IAM users
- use groups to assign permissions to IAM users
- grant least privilege
- configure a strong password policy for your users
- enable MFA for privileged users
- use roles for applications that run on Amazon EC2 instances
- delegate by using roles instead of by sharing credentials
- rotate credentials regularly
- remove unnecessary credentials
- use policy conditions for extra security
- monitor activity in your AWS account
- video presentation about IAM best practices

## Roles
Users can explicitly switch roles to perform tasks
Roles are universal - an use across any region
MFA can be added to specific roles

### Trust Policy
who is allowed to assume role

### Permissions Policy
allowed actions and resources

## Instance Roles
- provides access key information in output
- more secure than using access keys on instances
```console
$ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/role-name
```

### Assignment
Can only be assigned at instance creation
