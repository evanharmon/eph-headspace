# GOLANG TYPES

# PRIMITIVES
Strings
Ints
Floats
Booleans

## Non-Primitives
Structs

## Structs
almost always should be mutating bc these are non-primitive

## Passing Primitives
always copy value to functions / methods

## Passing Reference Types
pass a copy of any reference type - the pointer to the data is already
part of the struct
