# GOOGLE CLOUD IDENTITY
Global resource
Identity as a Service (IDaaS)

## Best Practice
always use service accounts rather than keys / user accounts even for local dev

## Cloud Platform Managed Keys
GCLOUD manages the keys and rotates once a day. Use these instead

## Directory Sync
can sync to LDAP or AD

## Identities
works with other google services like Chrome
can be used with SSO and other apps
