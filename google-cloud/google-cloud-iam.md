# GOOGLE CLOUD IAM
global resource
focused more on authorization, not identity

## Member
user, group, domain, service account, or public
- individual google account
- google group
- g suite / cloud iam domain

best practice to use groups and really never individual accounts

## Email Address
every identity has unique email address, even service accounts
