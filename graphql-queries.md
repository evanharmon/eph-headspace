GraphQL is really powerful but be warned that itâ€™s not SQL nor an ETL, you
can select the data you want, aggregate queries, change names but not join
queries or change the data structure

### Accept Array of Strings as Argument

only query needs to change - resolver can still look like

```
async getTeam(root, { ids }) {
  getUsers(id: [ID]!): Users
}
```

# Return Array of Objects in Resolver

have to use a list type of the object

```
type Post {
  id: Int
  date: Float
  text: String
}

type PostList {
  total: Int
  filtered: Int
  posts: [Post]
}

type Query {
  posts(id: Ind, offset: Int, limit: Int, filter: String): PostList
}

schema {
  query: Query
}
```
