# GRPC
very straightforward to the developer. Appears as if you are calling a
function directly on a server, no matter what the language

## Benefits
- works with many languages
- low latency
- efficient as its binary / serialized data smaller payload
- scaleable
- easy to implement auth / load balancing/ logging / monitoring middleware

## Proto File
This is the contract that is the same across any language

## Types of APIs
unary
server streaming
client streaming
bi-directional streaming

## Security
first class citizen

## Methodology
REST is more about CRUD
gRPC is open ended and api oriented. Think graphql - data driven design
