Uses clustered commodity of hardware instead of one machine

## MapReduce
breaks down jobs in to smaller pieces of work
fault-tolerant and will reschedule on another piece of hardware on failure

## YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)
keeps track of cluster resources and dynamically allocates - manages MapReduce
