# JAVASCRIPT VARIABLES

## Const
- the identifier won't be reassigned - not to be confused with immutable
- it is a constant reference - so that's why a const assigned to an object can
have properties changed
- adhere to block concept

## Let
- the variable may be reassigned
- variable will be used only in the block it's defined

## Typeof
Don't use typeof with const or let variables
