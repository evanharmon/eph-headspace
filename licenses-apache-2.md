# LICENSES APACHE 2

## General info
I’M NOT A LAWYER. WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN?
Describing legal documents in non-legalese is fraught with potential for
misinterpretation. Notwithstanding the text that follows, the actual text of
the license itself is legally binding and authoritative

That said, here’s what the Apache license says in layman’s terms:

### ALLOWS
It allows you to:
freely download and use Apache software, in whole or in part, for personal,
company internal, or commercial purposes

use Apache software in packages or distributions that you create

### FORBIDS
It forbids you to:
redistribute any piece of Apache-originated software without proper attribution;

use any marks owned by The Apache Software Foundation in any way that might
state or imply that the Foundation endorses your distribution

use any marks owned by The Apache Software Foundation in any way that might
state or imply that you created the Apache software in question

## REQUIRES
It requires you to:
include a copy of the license in any redistribution you may make that includes
Apache software

provide clear attribution to The Apache Software Foundation for any
distributions that include Apache software

## DOES NOT REQUIRE
It does not require you to:
include the source of the Apache software itself, or of any modifications you
may have made to it, in any redistribution you may assemble that includes it

submit changes that you make to the software back to the Apache Software
Foundation (though such feedback is encouraged)
