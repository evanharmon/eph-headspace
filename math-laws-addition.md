# MATH - LAWS OF ADDITION

## A1 commutative law
a + b = b + a
The order that you add is irrelevant, as long as you are only adding

## A2 associative law
a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c

## A3 zero is an additive identity
0 + a = a

## A4 additive inverses
for every number a there is a number b such that a + b = 0

## A5 cancellation law
if a, b, c are any three numbers and a +  b = a + c, then b = c
