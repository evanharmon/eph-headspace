# MATH - AREA

## Five Properties of Area
1. If you slide a shape about, its area does not change.
(two congruent shapes have same area)
2. If one shape is entirely contained in another, the area of the first is no
larger than area of the second
3. area of a rectangle is obtained by multiplying its two side lengths
4. If you cut a shape into a few pieces, areas of the pieces add up to area of
original shape
5. expand a shape by a factor of 2 in every direction, then its area multiplies
by 4
