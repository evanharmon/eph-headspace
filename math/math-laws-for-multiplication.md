# MATH - LAWS OF MULTIPLICATION

## M1 commutative law
ab = ba for any three numbers a, b, and c

## M2 associative law
a(bc) = (ab)c for any three numbers a, b, and c

## M3 multiplicative identity
1a = a for any number a

## D distributive law
(a + b)c = ac + bc for any three numbers a, b, and c

## M4 multiplicative inverses
for every number a apart from 0 there is a number c such that ac = 1

## M5 cancellation law
if a, b, and c are any three numbers, a is not 0 and ab = ac, then b = c
