## Summary

Notes on common errors in React

## Resources

[RWeiruch UnMounted Component Set State Warning](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-warning-cant-call-setstate-on-an-unmounted-component/)

## React must be in scope

make sure your import is capital R

```javascript
import React from 'react'
```

## Invariant

Bad

```javascript
export default React.createClass({})
```

Good

```javascript
const App = React.createClass({})
export default App
```

## Commenting in JSX

```javascript
{
  /* A JSX comment */
}
```

## Objects are not valid as a React child

Returning an object where React is expecting a string. Look for an empty object
inside a jsx comment, or a return statement mismatch between () and {}

## \_this is undefined

if using vanilla (non hooks) React, make sure the class has `super(props)`

example:

```jsx
class App extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
  }
  render() {
    return (</>)
  }
}
```
