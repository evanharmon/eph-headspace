## Context

[Avoid Passing Callbacks Down](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#how-to-avoid-passing-callbacks-down)

From the React Team:

```
If you use context to pass down the state too, use two different context types —
the dispatch context never changes, so components that read it don’t need to
rerender unless they also need the application state.
```

## Fetch Data With React Hooks

[Audisho.Sada Medium Example](https://medium.com/@audisho.sada/using-react-hooks-to-asynchronously-make-api-requests-1fdf52f797ce

In the future, `react-cache` and `suspense` will be used for data fetching

## Common Errors
