# SOFTWARE DESIGN DECORATOR PATTERN
The decorator adds its own behavior either before and/or after delegating to
the object it decorates to do the rest of the job

The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object
dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for
extending functionality
