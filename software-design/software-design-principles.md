# SOFTWARE DESIGN PRINCIPLES

## separate parts that change
Encapsulate those parts from the static parts

## Program to an interface not an implementation
Exploit polymorphism by programming to a supertype
Behaviors should be separate objects

## Favor composition over inheritance

## Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
