# TEAM TOPOLOGIES

## Summary
Notes after reading the book Team Topologies

## Team Types

Stream-aligned: majority of teams follow this model
Enabling
Complicated-subsystem: single complicated domain limit
Platform

## Team Makeup

Keep teams intact and pass work to the team. Shuffling teams is avoided
- 5 to 8 people

## Team Norms

- unblock others first
- no 'winning' arguments, only best choice among explored options
- codebase is responsibility of team and not individuals
- choose technologies with cognitive load in mind

## Team Formation
- design system / software boundaries to fit cognitive load of a team

## Ownership
A single team 'owns' a system / subsystem. Other teams can work with that team to make changes

## Cognitive Load
intrinsic: task fundamental to problem space
extraneous: environment around task (deployment / configuration)
germane: learning / value add to task

Monitor intrinsic cognitive load (domain complexity) to gauge need for additional teams

## Stream-aligned Team
autonomous team with non-blocking external dependencies
no hand-offs!

## Enabling Team
help stream-aligned teams by taking on research / trials to acquire missing capabilities

## Platform Team
- reduce cognitive load of other teams
- provide easy to consume services
