# TREES
Trees are acyclic connected graphs. Also known as n-ary trees

## Links
if we have a link between children then we do not need extra links from parent
to all children

## Treating as binary trees
We can treat all generic trees with a first child/ next sibling representation
as binary trees

## Pointers
Use firstChild and nextSibling in place of left / right
